# Mountaincar-v0-neuroevolution
Simple Neuroevolution solving Mountaincar v0

Neuroevolution using a simple genetic algorithm to evolve the weights of neural networks. 
Each neural network has only 10 hidden neurons.
Popsize is 100 and number of generation is 100, so run quickly (12 minutes on iMac Late 2013)
The solution is found after 60 generations. 
The best neural network after 100 generations can solve the mountaincar with 100% success rate (the episode before solves is 0).
